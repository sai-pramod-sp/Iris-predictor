# Making predictions on the Iris Dataset

This is dead simple and watered down `Machine Learning model selection and evaluation` project using  `Scikit-learn`(`Python`) for making predictions on the [Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) inspired by a tutorial by Dr. Jason Brownlee. <br>

Please click on the Jypyter notebook named [`Making predictions on the Iris Dataset.ipynb`](https://github.com/sai-pramod-sp/Iris-predictor/blob/main/Iris-predictor.ipynb) in the repo. <br>

Suggestions welcome!
